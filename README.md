## Description

This application prompts the user for an input in the form of a numerical value. The program then processes the inputted number and returns a running list beginning with one and ending at the inputted number. Throughout the sequence, the program has replaced certain numbers with words: numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with a "ping", numbers divisible by 5 are replaced with a "pong", and numbers divisible by 15 are replaced with "PingPong".
